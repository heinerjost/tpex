# tpex - Takeout Photo Exporter

**Status:** üöß _This project is under development._

I have a large photo collection stored in Google Photos and want to back it up on a local drive.

Unfortunately, Google only offers the Takeout format for this purpose. Photos are stored in folders by album and also by year. Some of the metadata I added later (e.g., location or capture date for digitized photos) are not stored in the EXIF data but are instead provided in a JSON file. This results in a rather confusing structure.

Therefore, I took a look at [Google Photos Takeouthelper](https://github.com/TheLastGimbus/GooglePhotosTakeoutHelper). However, I wasn‚Äôt satisfied with the result either. So I built the Takeout Photo Exporter.

## ‚úÖ Requirements
- üì¶ Direct use of ZIP files from the Takeout export.
- üóÇÔ∏è All file types included in the export are supported.
- üìÅ Albums are preserved as folders.
- üìÖ Albums containing only photos from a single year are moved to a folder named ‚ÄúPhotos yyyy.‚Äù Others remain in the main directory.
- üßπ Photos from the "Photos from yyyy" folders are only processed if they are not already part of an album. This helps avoid duplicates and improves organization.
- üñºÔ∏è For JPEG and JPG files:
  - The photo location is transferred from the JSON file into the image‚Äôs EXIF data.
  - The capture date is written to the EXIF data. Additionally, the file‚Äôs timestamp is set to the capture date.  
    Note: On the EXFAT file system, old photos taken before 1980 will receive the date 1/1/1980.
- üîí The original data remains untouched and is exported to a different directory.

## üì¶ Preparation
Export your photo files using [Google Takeout](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/9666875?hl=en) and save them in a directory on your computer. No other files should be stored in that directory.

## üì• Download
Downloads are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/heinerjost/tpex/tags).

## üõ†Ô∏è Runtime Requirements
A Java Runtime Environment >= 21 is required. For example, [OpenJDK25](https://jdk.java.net/25/).

## Running the Program
```bash
java -jar tpex-0.9.2.jar -z zip-directory -i input-directory -o output-directory -s file -l en
```
